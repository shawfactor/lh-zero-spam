Zero Spam makes blocking spam comments and registrations easy.

== Description ==

**Why should your users prove that they're humans by filling out captchas? Let bots prove they're not bots with the <a href="http://lhero.org/plugins/lh-zero-spam/">LH Zero Spam plugin</a>.**

LH Zero Spam blocks registration spam and spam in comments automatically without any config or setup. Zero Spam was initially built based on the work by <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/wordpress-comment-spam">David Walsh</a>, but enhanced with simpler code base and unobtrusive JavaScript.

Major features in WordPress Zero Spam include:

* **No captcha**, because spam is not users' problem
* **No moderation queues**, because spam is not administrators' problem
* **Blocks spam registrations & comments** with the use of JavaScript

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `lh-zero-spam` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is JavaScript required for this plugin to work? =

Yes, that's what does the magic and keeps spam bots out.

= I keep getting 'There was a problem processing your comment.' =

Be sure JavaScript is enabled and there are no JS errors.
